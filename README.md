PatientLevelPredictionUI
======================

Introduction
============
An UI built on top of the R package for building patient level predictive models using data in Common Data Model format.

Features
========
- Takes a cohort and outcome of interest as input.
- Extracts the necessary data from a database in OMOP Common Data Model format.
- Uses a large set of covariates including for example all drugs, diagnoses, procedures, as well as age, comorbidity indexes, etc.
- Large scale regularized regression to fit the predictive models.
- Includes function for evaluating predictive models
- Supported outcome models are logistic, Poisson, and survival (time to event). TO ADD.

Technology
==========
PatientLevelPredictionUI is a Shiny application running on R.
